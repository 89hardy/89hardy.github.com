<p>I’m a Computer Science engineer, fulltime Python, iOS developer and a Product fellow. I’m a musician and was a guitar trainer in my previous life.  I spend most of my free time reading. I’m an amateur photographer, a mountain person and have spent more than two years of my life in a quaint little town of Himachal Pradesh, India. So the “house in the hills’ part in the todos list has been checked, for now. I write whenever I feel like. I enjoy going for high altitude treks and losing whatever little precious kilos I gain throughout the year. I daydream a lot, about things which make sense and things which don’t.</p>


<p>I’m currently based out of Melbourne, Australia. The decision to come here was as poorly planned, as the decision to move to the hills. That worked out well, and hopefully, this will too. I came here to experience this foreign land, get a flying license, study some humanities subjects, all this while working as a fantastic developer and a product guy. It’s a lot of work, but that’s the pace at which my life usually moves. I believe I would’ve been a better humanities student, and I constantly try and explore that side of me. I also have a spiritual side too, yes. For those who don't know, spiritual and religious are two very different things. </p>
