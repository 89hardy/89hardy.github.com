I’m a Computer Science Engineer, Product Manager, and a Python, iOS developer. I’m a musician and was a guitar trainer in my previous life.  I spend most of my free time reading books, blogs, or anything interesting. I’m a big-time mountain person and have spent more than two years of my adult life in a quaint little town of Himachal Pradesh, India. So the “house in the hills’ checkbox has been ticked. I write whenever I feel like. I enjoy going for high altitude treks and losing whatever few precious kilos I gain throughout the year. I daydream a lot, about things which make sense and things which don’t.

I’m currently based out of Melbourne, Australia. I came here to live a different life, get a pilot license, study humanities subjects, and explore this foreign land. It’s a lot of work but that’s the pace at which my life usually moves. I have a spiritual side too. For those who don't know, spiritual and religious are two different things. I'm a resilient, strong-willed, empathetic, extroverted introvert individual, who likes to experience new things and believes in learning being a lifelong process. I have a zeal to live, I'm disciplined but not fond of routines. I'm extremely conscious of my mental well-being and like to help people explore this side of them. 

This blog is not my first. As of now, it will have posts related to products, coding, reviews, ideas, and sometimes, my current state of mind. In future, I plan to transfer my short-stories, travelogues and blog posts from my older blogs, and add more categories to this blog.

Happy reading!
