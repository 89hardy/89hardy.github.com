While I'm a computer science engineer by qualification, and have worked as an iOS and Python developer for about 4 yrs, it has been six years that I've written a line of any meaningful code. I've been a Product Manager and a Tech Consultant for last 6 yrs and have enjoyed doing it. In November 2019, I decided to move to Melbourne, Austalia from Delhi/Kasauli, India, and life has been a bit of a roller-coaster ever since. In last 6 months, I have seen terrible bushfires, a holiday season, and the corona virus lockdown. All my personal and professional plans have gone for a toss with no relief in sight. To make things worse, I also lost my last remote job in the process and have been struggling to find a good one ever since. In simple words, life hasn't been the best in last 6 months. And I'm sure I'm not the only one!

Being away from my family, friends and loved ones, the mind has also done what it does best: make me more anxious about my own life with every passing day. It's like a race against the time with no real end goal. It's like I'm racing to achieve something, but I don't know what. There are days when I feel that I'm chasing excellence, and then there are days when I feel that I'm just looking for a good job. All this has become too hazy to distinguish the good from the bad, right from wrong. There are days when I don't know what I want, and there are days when I don't why I am doing what I am doing. It's not the first time in my life that I'm feeling this way. I have dealt with these situation in the past, and will deal with it this time too. I can even talk about it and write about it now, but that probably comes with the age.

The reason I wrote some code and this blog exists is because I decided to get back to writing code again. This extraordinary situation of lockdown has taught me a few things. It has given me a lot of down-time to think about what I want from my life, and the direction in which our world as we see it is moving. And I've summarised it to three main points:

1. Irrespective of what you are doing, the work that you do should be more of a hard-skill than a soft-skill. We're moving to a world where the professions will be streamlined and the managerial part of the job is the risky part to be in.

2. I want my job to be location agnostic. I'm a big advocate of remote jobs.

3. Having lived both the lives, that of a developer and that of a manager, while both has merits and demerits, I think I know which one is better for the person that I am, and I'm willing and happy to invest my future time and energy into this.

I got back to practicing writing code last month and haven't looked back since. I've literally invested all my time, money and energy into this with a certain achievable goal in sight. I have a good feeling about this! While I do get doubts from time to time, yet, I'm mostly confident about this decision and I'm going to stick to it because I believe it's right. The idea is to keep my head down and keep working towards it, and build things, one thing at a time.

It's not easy, I can promise you that. And if you're not confident about it, you shouldn't do it. It took me a career of 9 yrs to figure out what I want to do. I hope you are smarter than me. I'm also aware of the fact that I'm back in the ring, competing with people from 15-65 yrs age group. And I'm okay with it! I'm confident about my decision, and I'm backing it till the end. I hope you find something where you feel the same way. If it's programming, do come back for future posts. If it's something else, I wish you luck!
